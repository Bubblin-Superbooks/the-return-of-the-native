The day was fine and clear; and the persons not being more than half a mile off she could see their every detail with the telescope. The woman walking in front carried a white bundle in her arms, from one end of which hung a long appendage of drapery; and when the walkers turned, so that the sun fell more directly upon them, Eustacia could see that the object was a baby. She called Charley, and asked him if he knew who they were, though she well guessed.</p><p>“Mrs. Wildeve and the nurse-girl,” said Charley.</p><p>“The nurse is carrying the baby?” said Eustacia.</p><p>“No, 'tis Mrs. Wildeve carrying that,” he answered, “and the nurse walks behind carrying nothing.”</p></div> </div>
