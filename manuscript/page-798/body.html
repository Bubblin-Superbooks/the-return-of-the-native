Whatever I may feel I promise you on my word of honour never to speak to you about—or act upon—until you say I may. I know my duty to Thomasin quite as well as I know my duty to you as a woman unfairly treated. What shall I assist you in?”</p><p>“In getting away from here.”</p><p>“Where do you wish to go to?”</p><p>“I have a place in my mind. If you could help me as far as Budmouth I can do all the rest. Steamers sail from there across the Channel, and so I can get to Paris, where I want to be. Yes,” she pleaded earnestly, “help me to get to Budmouth harbour without my grandfather's or my husband's knowledge, and I can do all the rest.”</p><p>“Will it be safe to leave you there alone?”</p><p>“Yes, yes. I know Budmouth well.”</p></div> </div>
