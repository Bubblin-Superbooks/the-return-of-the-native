No, Eustacia.”</p><p>“Men can, women cannot.”</p><p>“Well, whatever I may have thought, one thing is certain—I do love you—past all compass and description. I love you to oppressiveness—I, who have never before felt more than a pleasant passing fancy for any woman I have ever seen. Let me look right into your moonlit face and dwell on every line and curve in it! Only a few hairbreadths make the difference between this face and faces I have seen many times before I knew you; yet what a difference—the difference between everything and nothing at all. One touch on that mouth again! there, and there, and there. Your eyes seem heavy, Eustacia.”</p><p>“No, it is my general way of looking. I think it arises from my feeling sometimes an agonizing pity for myself that I ever was born.”</p></div> </div>
