Willy Orchard said he seed a red ghost here t'other day—perhaps that was you?”</p><p>“I was here t'other day.”</p><p>“Were you making that dusty light I saw by now?”</p><p>“Oh yes, I was beating out some bags. And have you had a good bonfire up there? I saw the light. Why did Miss Vye want a bonfire so bad that she should give you sixpence to keep it up?”</p><p>“I don't know. I was tired, but she made me bide and keep up the fire just the same, while she kept going up across Rainbarrow way.”</p><p>“And how long did that last?”</p><p>“Until a hopfrog jumped into the pond.”</p><p>The reddleman suddenly ceased to talk idly. “A hopfrog?” he inquired. “Hopfrogs don't jump into ponds this time of year.”</p></div> </div>
