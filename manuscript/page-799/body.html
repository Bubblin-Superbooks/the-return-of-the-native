Command me in anything till that time.”</p><p>“I will think of this,” she said hurriedly. “Whether I can honestly make use of you as a friend, or must close with you as a lover—that is what I must ask myself. If I wish to go and decide to accept your company I will signal to you some evening at eight o'clock punctually, and this will mean that you are to be ready with a horse and trap at twelve o'clock the same night to drive me to Budmouth harbour in time for the morning boat.”</p><p>“I will look out every night at eight, and no signal shall escape me.”</p></div> </div>
