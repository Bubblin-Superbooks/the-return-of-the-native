<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>7</h4><h5 class="  ">Queen Of Night</h5><p>Eustacia Vye was the raw material of a divinity. On Olympus she would have done well with a little preparation. She had the passions and instincts which make a model goddess, that is, those which make not quite a model woman. Had it been possible for the earth and mankind to be entirely in her grasp for a while, she had handled the distaff, the spindle, and the shears at her own free will, few in the world would have noticed the change of government. There would have been the same inequality of lot, the same heaping up of favours here, of contumely there, the same generosity before justice, the same perpetual dilemmas, the same captious alteration of caresses and blows that we endure now.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">She was in person full-limbed and somewhat heavy;</p></div> </div>
