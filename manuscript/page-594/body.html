Is there anything you dislike in me that you act so contrarily to my wishes? I am your wife, and why will you not listen? Yes, I am your wife indeed!”</p><p>“I know what that tone means.”</p><p>“What tone?”</p><p>“The tone in which you said, 'Your wife indeed.' It meant, 'Your wife, worse luck.'”</p><p>“It is hard in you to probe me with that remark. A woman may have reason, though she is not without heart, and if I felt 'worse luck,' it was no ignoble feeling—it was only too natural. There, you see that at any rate I do not attempt untruths. Do you remember how, before we were married, I warned you that I had not good wifely qualities?”</p></div> </div>
